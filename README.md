# magento-cms-dumper
A Magento1 module to dump and import cms content, so you can easy sync this content via vcs and your normal deployment workflow

Hint: yes I know this is not a fully valid module, feel free to do a PR

## Todo

* check if the import for blocks does even work (not tested yet, had enough after it worked for pages)
* allow import/export of single IDs via commandline argument
* add modman file
* add composer.json
* add proper module structure/config
* ask people if they want this functionality for M2
* add doku for usage together with setup scripts (like, just call this one method of the service class)
